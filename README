# tutch
tutch is a tool for checking constructive proofs

I'm not the developer of this software.
The official website can be found here:
    http://www2.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/~abel/tutch/.
This repo is almost an exact copy of the sources for tutch-0.52
you can find on their website, with a few differences being
that it is made to be compiled by MLton rather than smlnj.
It requires the MLSuccessor features of MLton, so a 2015 version
of MLton must be used.
